          <h3>Our Mission</h3>

          <p>
            Pacific Trails' mission is to bring the best experience possible so
            that all it's guests can enjoy the most out of their trip! It was
            founded with the aim of showcasing nature and allowing those that
            visit us a special window to the natural world without sacrificing
            any of the comforts that would make for a pleasant stay.
          </p>
          <h3>Environmental Promise</h3>
          <p>
            Pacific Trails Resort was founded with cooperation with the state's
            nature conservation programs to ensure that the natural environment
            would be preserved even in light of human presence and activity. The
            Resort is dedicated to donating a portion of its proceeds back
            towards environmental organization as well as the park's own
            conservation team!
