My favorite beverage is the Dr Pepper soda. I love that the flavor of it isn't like any other soda, although it is similiar to a root beer. Many people find the taste to be reminiscent of medicine, which I don't think it does, but many don't know that the soda was originally meant to be actual medicine, it was invented by a pharmacist at the beginning of the 20th century and sold at his drug store. What is also interesting is that the actual recipe for the soda is a secret, but it is said that it contains 23 distinct flavors, though I can't say that you would be able to taste them. Overall, I really like this soda for it's flavor and interesting history I would rate it at 5/5.
